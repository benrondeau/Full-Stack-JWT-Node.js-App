# Full Stack Node.js App with JWT Authentication

Front and back-end app on Node.js using JWT for authentication. Back-end uses Express as middleware and front-end uses Angular for its SPA framework.

This app is an example from the workshop I taught at JSconfEU 2015.

### Requirements
- Node.js v4.0+ (app uses ES6)

### Get Started
- Download Repo
- cd into project directory and `npm install`
- `node server.js`
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and use credentials `user` and `password` to login
- Open web console to see JWT issued
- Click 'Logout' button in navbar to delete token
